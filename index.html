<p>Fuber is meant to be an easy to use app for iOS or Android built using the Ionic framework for mobile development and AngularJS on the front-end and incorporating MongoDB, Express, and Node.js for server-side development.</p>

<p>Fuber was created to be a tool for food truck proprieters who wish to broadcast to a large audience their constant location as well as customers who seek to find food truck options in real time or a specific truck's location at any given time.</p>

<p>Currently, most food truck locations can only be found by customers following the truck owner's tweets on twitter or status updates on facebook.  Some trucks use other websites to broadcast their locations or schedules they might be following.  However, this causes a burden on both the truck owner and the customer.  </p>

<p>Truck owners must constantly tweet or share their locations with each move they make.  They must also rely on customers following them on social media, and, from the customer stand point, locating a food truck through tweets or other social media outlets can not only be user-UNfriendly but can often be inaccurate as it applies to a truck's current location. (i.e. the truck might leave its current location an hour or so after tweeting without updating that information on social media.)</p>

<p>With Fuber, the truck user simply turns on his/her location services within the app, broadcasting the truck's location.  Customers logged in can then easily locate trucks near them and/or specific trucks by name or cuisine.  Additionally, as long as the truck user leaves the app running in the background, customer users can follow trucks on the move in real time using Google Maps.</p>

<p>My hope is that this app can help the food truck community grow and thrive in areas where food truck business can sometimes have lulls.  Putting buyers in contact with sellers when both parties are in need of each other is how businesses thrive.  I believe this application will do just that and help sync customers and restaurarteurs needs in an easy, inexpensive way.</p>
